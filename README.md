# My portfolio!

This is my portfolio! This is the webpage I created to represent my software skills online. I am continuously updating it and finding better ways to improve the experience. After all, I have to make myself stand out.

Not much JavaScript went into this page. It's mainly HTML and CSS since it's relatively static besides the few animations.

It utilizes Bootstrap for the navbar and projects section. There's a bit of jQuery in there to allow for the smooth scrolling when a navbar item is clicked.

I will be updating the contact section soon to allow users to send a message directly to my email.
